        <p><strong>Dinosaur Bar-B-Que:</strong><br>
            A Syracuse institution, Dinosaur Bar-B-Que serves some of the best slow- cooked BBQ in the country. Known for its bold, smoky flavors, you can’t go wrong with the pulled pork, brisket, or St. Louis-style ribs. Pair them with classic sides like mac and cheese, fried green tomatoes, or the fan-favorite BBQ beans. The lively atmosphere, with live blues and rock music, adds to the authentic BBQ experience.</p>

        <p><strong>Pastabilities:</strong><br>
            Located in the heart of Armory Square, Pastabilities is famous for its house-made pastas and artisan sauces. Their signature dish is Hot Tomato Oil, a spicy dipping sauce served with fresh stretch bread, which has gained a cult following. Popular dishes include the Chicken Riggies and the Duck Bacon Flatbread. The cozy, rustic interior makes it a great spot for both casual meals and special occasions.</p>


        <p><strong>Apizza Regionale:</strong><br>
            If you love wood-fired pizza, this is the place to go. Apizza Regionale offers a true farm-to-table experience, with local ingredients featured on every pie. Try their Margherita pizza for a taste of classic Naples or indulge in the Pepperoni and Hot Honey, where spicy meets sweet. The casual, laid-back vibe makes it perfect for a relaxed dinner.</p>

        <p><strong>Funk 'n Waffles:</strong><br>
            For a truly unique combination, head to Funk 'n Waffles, where creative waffle dishes meet live music. They offer everything from savory options like the Jive Turkey (a waffle topped with turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce) to sweet concoctions like the Banana Bread Waffle. It’s the perfect spot for brunch or a late-night bite, and their regular live music performances make every visit special.
