        My name is Kiamesha McMillian. I am a junior majoring in Information Management Technology at Syracuse University. I am aspiring to be a Product Manager. Recently over the summer I completed an internship at Ernst & Young LLP working within the Technology Risk department. I have been on the Deanâ€™s list for 2 years straight! Outside of work and school I love spending time with my nieces and nephews watching them grow up into bright little people. I also enjoy spending time with my partner exploring nature. I am a very relaxed person and I love to just every moment in life.
